 NAPOLEON COMMANDER

  This application is a simple dual PANE file commander inspired by Norton (Volkov,...) commanders.
 It has just basic functionality but is still (hopefully) useful.

 
 1. PANES

  The app is controlled by two panes, left and right and either pane can be switched to the active
 state with the TAB key. The active pane has a "cursor" and a "header"; both are indicated by an
 inverse line of text. Source for any pane can be chosen with ALT+F1/F2 keys, it could be either SD
 card or SERVER = Python script serving files through standard USB A-B cable for CMM2 power supply.
 (For this functionality have to be set OPTION CONSOLE SCREEN + OPTION CONSOLE SAVE)

 The cursor on the  active pane is moved UP or DOWN using the arrow keys, and the HOME/END keys
 select the first and last lines. The A-Z keys select the first file beginning with that character
 if one exists.

 The cursor selects the ACTIVE ITEM. A RED cursor indicates a HIDDEN file which begins with '.'
 Hidden files and folders can be toggled between SHOWN/HIDDEN with uppercase 'H' and status is
 indicated on the bottom left.

 Normally pane items are shown SORTED but this can be switched off using uppercase 'U' with status
 indicated on the bottom left. Display of DIRs before FILEs, or vice versa, can be set in the
 CONFIGURATION file.

 
 2. ACTIVE ITEM

  ACTIONS can be performed on ACTIVE ITEMs. Some of them depend on the differences between panes
 but most are invoked by function keys. Some just use "normal" keys (see Shortcuts).

 
 
 
 3. ACTIONS

 The source for actions is the selected item on the active pane; destination is the inactive pane. 
  
  COPY   Copies files or folders to a new directory. When both panes contain the same directory,  
         the copied item must be named differently. App "AI" can propose a new name for you.

  MOVE   Same as COPY, but source item is deleted and the folder move temporarily disabled.

  DELETE Deletes file or folder; the folder doesn't have to be empty. VERY DANGEROUS ACTION!!!

  L=R    Duplicates the active pane to the inactive pane.

 For some actions only the source file or folder is required.
   
  GET INFO  For folders this calculates size and number of items - for files just returns size.
 
  VIEWER     Shows file as text or HEX using ALT+F3. Currently only works for BMP files but in
             future (using SUB CALL) external viewers could be called based on the file extension.
             Viewer isn't limited by file size (except by speed) but doesn't work on directories.

  EDITOR     Extension of the VIEWER, not done (yet?).

  MAKE DIR   Create new folder in active directory.


  SCREENSHOT Function (PRINT SCREEN) works strangely because ofthe IMAGE SAVE limitation.
             After the keypress the shot is stored to memory, then later saved to disk.
             Pressing LEFT ALT+PRINT SCREEN can "shoot" just an open dialog window.

 
 
 
 
 
 Some settings can be changed with F11 (CONFIGURATION). They are stored in the CFG file and loaded
 on program start. Try them out:
 	
 	External viewers enabled            F3 calls EXTviewXXX for externsion XXX (VIEWER.INC)
 	External actions enabled            ENTER calls EXTactionXXX for externsion XXX (ACTION.INC)
 	ESC to parent dir                   ESC works same way as ENTER on .. [ GO UP ]
 	DIRs before FILEs                   MS WINDOWS's way to look on items list
 	TEXT VIEWER fallback (BIN else)     If selected, F3 for unknown extension starts TXT viewer
 	HIGH COLOR mode                     NC runs in more colors of MODE 1,16 (standard 1,8)
 	FAST SERIAL SERVER            	    Communication with speed 691200 instead of 230400
 	
  
 F10 will quit the App.

                                                                                Enjoy it!
