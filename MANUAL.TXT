 NAPOLEON COMMANDER

  This application is a simple dual PANE file commander inspired by Norton (Volkov,...) commanders.
 It has just basic functionality but is still (hopefully) useful.
 
 1. PANES

  The app is controlled by two panes, left and right and either pane can be switched to the active
 state with the TAB key. The active pane has a "cursor" and a "header"; both are indicated by an
 inverse line of text. The source of files/folders for either pane is chosen with the ALT+F1/F2
 keys and can be either the SD card or a SERVER. The SERVER option uses Python script to serve
 files from a laptop or PC via the standard USB A-B cable which also supplies the CMM2's power.
 (This SERVER functionality requires OPTION CONSOLE SCREEN and OPTION CONSOLE SAVE to be set.)

 The cursor on the  active pane is moved UP/DOWN using the arrow keys, and the HOME/END keys
 select the first and last lines. The A-Z keys select the first file beginning with that character
 if one exists.

 The cursor also selects the ACTIVE ITEM. A RED cursor indicates a HIDDEN file which begins with
 the period character '.'  Hidden files and folders can be toggled between SHOWN/HIDDEN using
 CTRL+H and status is indicated on the bottom left of the screen.

 Normally pane items are shown SORTED but this can be switched off using CTRL+U with status again
 indicated on the bottom left. Display of DIRs before FILEs, or vice versa, can be set in the
 CONFIGURATION file.
 
 2. ACTIVE ITEM

  The selected ACTIVE ITEM can have ACTIONS performed on it. Some actions depend on the differences
  between  panes, but most are invoked by function keys. Some use "normal" keys (see Shortcuts).
  
 
 
 
 
 3. ACTIONS

 The source for actions is the selected item on the active pane; destination is the inactive pane. 
  
  COPY   Copies files or folders to a new directory. When both panes contain the same directory,  
         the copied item must be named differently. App "AI" can propose a new name for you.

  MOVE   Same as COPY, but source item is later deleted.

  DELETE Deletes the file or folder; the folder doesn't have to be empty. VERY DANGEROUS ACTION!!!

  LP=RP  Duplicates the active pane to the inactive pane.

 For some actions only the source file or folder is required.
   
  GET INFO   For folders this calculates size and number of items - for files tries to display some
             informations.
 
  VIEWER     Shows file as text or HEX using ALT+F3. Currently only works for BMP files but in
             future (using SUB CALL) external viewers could be called based on the file extension.
             Viewer isn't limited by file size (except by speed) but doesn't work on directories.

  HEX EDIT   Like HEX viewer, use either HEX mumber or ALT+character to replace one under cursor.
             Changes are after pressing ENTER immediately writen to file!!! 

  MAKE DIR   Create new folder in active directory.
  
  MAKE MAR   Create .MAR archive from directory tree, unarchive with ENTER
  
  COMPRESS   Compress file into .ARC file (RLE or HUFFMAN compression), decompress with ENTER
  
  SCREENSHOT Function (PRINT SCREEN) works 'strange', because of the IMAGE SAVE limitation.
             After the key-press the 'shot' is stored to memory (lighting effect), then later saved
             to disk.
             Pressing LEFT ALT+PRINT SCREEN can 'shoot' just an open dialog window.
 Some settings can be changed with F11 (CONFIGURATION). They are stored in the CFG file and loaded
 on program start. Try them out:
  
  External viewers enabled            F3 calls EXTviewXXX for extension XXX (VIEWER.INC)
  External actions enabled            ENTER calls EXTactionXXX for extension XXX (ACTION.INC)
  ESC to parent directory             ESC works the same as ENTER on '..' i.e. GO UP a level
  DIRs before FILEs                   View of list as used by MS WINDOWS
  TEXT VIEWER fallback (HEX else)     If selected, F3 for unknown extension starts TXT viewer
  HIGH COLOR mode                     NC runs in 65k colours (MODE 1,16) instead of 256 (MODE 1,8)
  FAST SERIAL SERVER                  Communication at 691200 baud instead of 230400
  ESP8266 installed                   In CMM2 is installed WiFi module and shoul be used


 F10 shows ABOUT dialog (incl. ESP + WiFi info), ALT+F10 will quit the App.

                                                                                Enjoy it!
